# azure-vm-backup-and-recovery-lab
Hands-on lab project that demonstrates how to configure backup, monitoring, and disaster recovery for Azure virtual machines using Recovery Services vaults and Azure Site Recovery.

# Azure VM Backup & Disaster Recovery Lab

## Overview

This project is a hands-on lab to demonstrate how to back up and replicate Azure virtual machines using:

- **Recovery Services vault**
- **Azure Backup Policies**
- **Azure Site Recovery for disaster recovery**

The lab was completed as part of my Azure learning journey and aligns with key responsibilities of a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer or Site Reliability Engineer (SRE).
